Code for unbinned likelihood analysis of astroparticle physics data.
Both time-dependent and time-independent analyses can be performed, as well as a "flare-search" algorithm to find event clustering in time as well as space.

Performs single point source analyses, as well as the stacking of sources according to predefined weighting.
Also performs stacking analyses where the signal strength of each source is fit individually.
