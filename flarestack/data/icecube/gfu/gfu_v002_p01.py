Path to local copy of point source tracks, downloaded on 16/05/18 from
/data/ana .. /current, with the following readme:

    * better pull-correction using splines, instead of polynomial fits

This is the sample that was used for the original TXS analysis in 2017
(NOT THE ONE THAT INCLUDED ADDITIONAL DATA UP TO SPRING 2018!)
